    Trajectory contains approximately 200 frames (just a *guess* from the file size of 27.04 MiB).

    4700 atoms in the system: 500x C, 2800x H, 200x N, 1200x O

    System extent:  X = {   -916 ..  +4672 pm }, dX = 5589 pm
      (in step 1)   Y = {   -999 ..  +4807 pm }, dY = 5806 pm

    The "advanced mode" offers seldomly required features, including support for non-orthorhombic
    simulation cells, NPT ensemble, non-periodic systems, user-definded virtual atoms, pseudomolecules, ...

    Use the advanced mode until the analysis selection menu (y/n)? [no] 

    Found cell geometry data in trajectory file:

      X = 3720.00 pm,   Y = 3720.00 pm,   Z = 3720.00 pm

    The overall box density is 0.994420 g/cm^3.

    Assuming a 3D-periodic cell.

    Use these values (y) or enter different values (n)? [yes] 
    Update cell geometry in every time step (i.e., NPT ensemble) (y) or use fixed cell (n)? [yes] n

*** Warning: Some of the atoms were found to be very close to each other (distance < 50 pm).
             This usually indicates a problem, e.g. an incorrect cell vector.

    Continue with molecule recognition anyways (y/n)? [yes]
